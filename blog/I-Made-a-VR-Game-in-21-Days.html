<p>
Today is the last day of my challenge to learn virtual reality development in 21 days. Over the past few days, I made a few small additions/changes to my game. Today, I finished the game!
</p>
<p>
I changed/added five more pieces to the game over the past few days.
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>1. I removed the drones.</strong> I replaced them with characters who move across the room. These moving characters are harder to hit than characters who stand still.
</li>
<li>
<strong>2. New designs.</strong> The game was a little bland with only one type of construction worker and one type of bad guy. So, I added new character designs to spice things up.
</li>
<li>
<strong>3. Background music.</strong> What kind of game would it be without background music? Not a fun one. Music is necessary.
</li>
<li>
<strong>4. I updated the crosshair design.</strong> The crosshair is cool because it only shows up when the player is shooting. It's a challenge because instead of aiming then shooting. The player has to shoot then aim.
</li>
<li>
<strong>5. New score system (game mechanics).</strong> I took a hint from Fruit Ninja on this one. In Fruit Ninja, there's a 60-second timer that counts down until the round is over. When the player slices a fruit, they gain a point. When the player slices a bomb, they lose time from their timer. My game will use similar mechanics. I'll replace fruit with bad guys and bombs with construction workers.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Final Product</h2>
<p>
The rules of the game are simple. Shoot the bad guys, don't shoot the construction workers. The player has 60 seconds to hit as many bad guys as possible.
</p>
<p>
I'll put a video of me playing the game below. If you have some coding experience and want to try the game out for yourself, check out the source code on GitHub:
