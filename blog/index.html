<h2>I Made a VR Game in 21 Days</h2>
<p>Today is the last day of my challenge to learn virtual reality development in 21 days. Over the past few days, I made a few small additions/changes to my game. Today, I finished the game!</p> <p><a href="https://evanmays.com/blog/I-Made-a-VR-Game-in-21-Days">Read more</a></p>

<h2>I'm Learning VR Day 15: Optimizing my Game</h2>

<h2>I'm Learning VR Day 13: Building the White Void</h2>
<p>Today is day 13 of my challenge to learn virtual reality development in 21 days. I already had a working game and an idea of how I wanted it to look. Over the last few days, I brought the aesthetic of the game to life. You can see the game's new logo above!</p> <p><a href="https://evanmays.com/blog/Building-the-White-Void-Day-13-of-Learning-VR">Read more</a></p>

<h2>I'm Learning VR Day 8: Naming the Game</h2>
<p>Today is day 8 of my challenge to learn virtual reality development in 21 days. Iâ€™ve got a working game. However, it is mega ugly. I tried a few new designs over the past few days, but today I decided on the right aesthetic and picked a great name.</p> <p><a href="https://evanmays.com/blog/Naming-the-Game-Day-8-of-Learning-VR">Read more</a></p>

<h2>I'm Learning VR Day 1: Making the Virtual World</h2>
<p>Today is day 1 of my challenge to learn virtual reality. I want to create a game, and I've never done any virtual reality before. The first step is figuring out how to make a virtual world. It started off as a cylinder, a block, and a sphere. I added walls, a ceiling, and a TV to develop it further. Eventually, I was satisfied with version 0.1 of my virtual world.</p> <p><a href="https://evanmays.com/blog/Making-the-Virtual-World-Day-1-of-Learning-VR">Read more</a></p>

<h2>I'm learning VR in 21 Days</h2>
<p>I'm learning virtual reality (VR)! I've never done anything in VR before, but in 21 days, I'll have a demo version of a sci-fi target practice game. Imagine laser beams that shoot from your eyes, arcade-style levels that increase in difficulty, and hopefully astonishing graphics.</p> <p><a href="https://evanmays.com/blog/Im-Learning-VR-in-21-Days">Read more</a></p>
