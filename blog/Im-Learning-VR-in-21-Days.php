		                	I'm learning virtual reality (VR)! I've never done anything in VR before, but in 21 days, I'll have a demo version of a sci-fi target practice game. Imagine laser beams that shoot from your eyes, arcade-style levels that increase in difficulty, and hopefully astonishing graphics.

		                	Why VR
		                </h2>
		                <p>
		                	I learned how to code from making platformer games (Think arcade Mario). It was hands down some of the most fun I had as a kid. But, I haven't made a game in years.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                	What better way to jump back into game making than to jump in the game with VR.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                	If you've never been in VR before, you're missing out. VR could have life-changing applications. It's a lot easier for people to design virtual worlds than to build them physically. Here are some examples of a future with VR.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                	Disney World could be in your living room. Watching a sports game from home could be as immersive as standing in the stadium. And the bedroom could be a place for nighttime dreaming and daytime dreaming with VR that creates any world you can imagine.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                	Maybe some of that will happen, perhaps some of it won't. I want it to happen though. And I want to have a part in it, so I'll start with a fun game.
		                </p>
		                <h2>
		                	You can play the game too!
		                </h2>
		                <img class="medium-blog-img" src="//evanmays.com/assets/img/Google_Cardboard-Annotated-Image.jpg" />
		                <p>
		                	If you don't have a fancy VR headset, you're in the same boat as me. What I do have (and you probably have it too) is a modern smartphone. I also have a Google Cardboard headset. It's affordable ($20) and lasts for a long time. Luckily, that's all you'll need to play my VR game.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                	My Cardboard headset was a gift for attending an event at my school. If you don't have a headset, you can still play the game in the browser thanks to WebVR. WebVR sounds fancy, so let me explain.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                	WebVR is an alternative to buying a $1,000 gaming PC and a $1,000 VR headset. It's a free platform that lets developers build VR experiences for the masses. I'm making my game using WebVR, so if you have a phone or laptop with internet, you can play the game on my website.

		                	Why 21 Days?
		                </h2>
		                <p>
		                	The first day of classes for the Spring semester is January 29th. Since today is January 5th, I'll have just enough time to finish before classes start.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                	Plus, 21 rolls off the tongue.
